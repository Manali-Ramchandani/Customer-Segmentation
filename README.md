# Customer-Segmentation

## Overview
This project applies the K-Means Clustering algorithm to segment customers of a mall based on their shopping patterns and demographics. The goal is to identify target customer groups for more effective marketing strategies. This analysis is presented through an interactive Streamlit application, making it accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## Objective
To utilize unsupervised machine learning (K-Means Clustering) for identifying distinct customer segments within a mall. This segmentation aims to empower the marketing team with insights to tailor their strategies, optimize marketing spend, and enhance customer engagement and loyalty.

## Features
- **Data Exploration:** Interactive visualizations to understand the dataset.
- **Clustering Analysis:** Application of K-Means Clustering to segment customers.
- **Interactive Results:** Streamlit dashboard to explore different customer segments.
- **Actionable Insights:** Recommendations for marketing strategies based on customer segments.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for K-Means Clustering
- Streamlit for creating the web application
